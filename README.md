Project Structure
This project follows the MVVM folder structure pattern. MVVM stands for: Model View ViewModel.

Model: a single source of truth for a data structure. So if you have any sort of data to represent in the app, you will basically create it in a model. The model can either be a struct or a class.

ViewModel: The purpose of the ViewModel folder is to contain all business logic to manipulate models defined within the project.

View: The view is a presentational layer. All reusable view or screen implementation will be done here.

Controllers: holds individual screens within the app.

Extension: this folder holds all reusable extention code.

(Note: as time goes on the additional folders when needed will be added)
